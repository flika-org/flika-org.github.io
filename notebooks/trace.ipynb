    "    Trace Window to visualize average pixel values over time.  When a TraceFig is created, it is automatically set to g.m.currentTrace. Trace Windows are used to plot traces from ROIs for visual comparison and analysis. The mouse X-index position is automatically linked to the Window frame index\n",

    "    -p1: pyqtgraph PlotWidget used to plot the zoomed in range selected from the full trace\n",
    "    -p2: pyqtgraph PlotWidget below p1 used to plot the whole trace. A LinearRegionItem is provided to previewa selected range\n",
    "    -region: pyqtgraph LinearRegionItem used to select a region of the whole trace from p2\n",
    "    -rois: list of the ROIs that are plotted in the traceWindow, as a list of dictionaries [{'roi': ROI, 'p1trace': PlotDataItem, 'p2trace': PlotDataItem, 'toBeRedrawn': Boolean, 'toBeRedrawnFull': Boolean}, ...]\n",

    "    -indexChanged: emits the x-index of the mouse when the user moves the mouse over the traceWindow\n",
    "    -finishedDrawingSignal: emitted when the traceWindow has finished plotting all its traces\n",
