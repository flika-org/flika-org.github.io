    "# How to make a Flika plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins are software that extend Flika's functionality.  In this tutorial, we will describe how to create your own plugin to add to Flika.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your plugin, if you'd like to import software from another Flika plugin, you can import by referencing the plugin directory.  For example, if the plugin is called 'puffs', the file containing the desired function is called 'threshold_cluster', and the function in that plugin is 'threshold_cluster', use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\tfrom plugins.puffs.threshold_cluster import threshold_cluster\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add the plugin to the FLIKA database, it must be organized in a way that FLIKA can read.\n",

    "It should be noted that the above info.xml file will create a Menu titled \"Plugin Name\" and add subaction \"ActionText\" and submenus \"Menu 1\", \"Menu 2\" with their child actions/menus.  The location and function attributes of the action tags help define what method is executed when the action is triggered.\n",
    "\n",

    "### IMPORTANT: \n",
    "URL zip files must have a single folder containing the plugin code, as well as an \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py and a sample.xml file.\n",
    "The base_dir and name must match EXACTLY with import statements in code and with the Flika plugin_data.txt file.\n",
    "When the author makes an update to a Plugin, he/she should set the date attribute to the current date and update the info.xml file.  FLIKA will automatically refer to this file to alert users if updates are available.\n",
